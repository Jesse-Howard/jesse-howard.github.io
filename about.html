<div class="projectdesc">
Jesse Howard is a designer, researcher, and educator based in Amsterdam. His work focuses on reimagining everyday objects in response to new forms of digital fabrication, distributed development, and DIY communities. 
As an initiator of the ongoing collaborative platform Hacking Households, his research often centers around a close investigation on how the tools and practices of open source software development could 
serve as models for new networks and systems of production. After earning a degree in mathematics from Colorado College, Jesse relocated to the Netherlands, and graduated from the designLAB at the Gerrit
Rietveld Academie in 2011.
