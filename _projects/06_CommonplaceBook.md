A Commonplace Book (2018) is an installation in which visitors are invited to compile fragments of research into blank notebooks. Each table in the installation displays a time-related object and is integrated with a with custom drawing machine which reproduces related experts, drawings, and fragments of research. The result is a series of individually-published  personal books that explore our perception and understanding of time. Produced in collaboration with [Commonplace Studio](https://www.commonplace.nl/)  and [Tim Knapen](https://www.timknapen.be/), and based on the content of the Z33 research group [Studio Time](https://www.z33.be/en/artikel/time-school-or-a-school-of-time/).
