Cloning Objects presents an alternative scenario in which a collection of products are each embedded with all of the information needed for their own reproduction. Scanning the object with a software interface allows a user to “inspect” the components of an object, revealing the digital 3D-definition, files for reproduction with digital fabrication tools, information and schematics for electronic components, and the source-code for any software used to control the object.

Distributing this information within the objects allows them to be reproduced and distributed without a structured, formal network. The autonomous objects and their components are made accessible on an individual level, and can be freely shared, modified, and redistributed.

Cloning objects is made in collaboration with Leonaro Amico, Tilen Sepi&#269; , and Thibault Brevet. It is an extension of the Hacking Households project originally presented at BIO 50. The project was made possible with support from Timelab and the Creative Industries Fund NL.
