Producing even relatively simple objects often requires combining existing components that vary in terms of local sources, standards, and availability. The PS Desklamp (2014) is based on a set of 3D-printed components which have the ability to adapt to the dimensions of standard construction materials: measurements which are readily available from the databases maintained by the material suppliers. The balanced-arm lamps based can be constructed from a variety of locally available materials: from wooden beams to metal pipes. Parametric design software allows the 3D-printable components to be customized to fit the chosen construction material and standard lightbulb socket.
