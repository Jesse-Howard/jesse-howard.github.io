Created for the [Candle Smart Home](https://www.candlesmarthome.com/) project initiated by [Tijmen Schep](https://www.tijmenschep.com/), these prototypes imagine new typologies of smart-home devices designed through consideration of a user’s privacy. Each device integrates elements that propose new approaches to privacy through everyday objects: from mechanical switches that reveal when a device is remotely accessed, to settings which allow the user to generate ‘fake’ data to mask behaviors. The series consists of a thermostat, a carbon sensor, a smart-home hub, an enegy-use monitor, and the anemone: a device that physically disconnects the internet connection entering the home.
