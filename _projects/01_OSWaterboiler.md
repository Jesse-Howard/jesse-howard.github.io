The OS WaterBoiler is an appliance designed for the OpenStructures modular building system. Straightforward design principles and standard components are utilized to create an understandable appliance that can be disassembled, repaired, and modified.

Designed in collaboration with Thomas Lomm√©e for [OpenStructures](https://www.openstructures.net).
