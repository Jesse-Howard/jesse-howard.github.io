A “Do-It-Yourself” mentality is emerging in the field of healthcare. On one hand, this trend could give patients and practitioners increased agency to understand, manage, and take control of their individual needs and situations. Simultaneously, it creates an increasingly complex set of relationships in which patients, healthcare professionals, activists, software companies, and retailers may all have very different stakes in, and definitions of DIY healthcare.
Data and Devices (2018) consists of a trio which question and suggest alternatives within the field of “Do-It-Yourself” healthcare. Inspired by implanted pacemaker monitoring systems which rely on a complex, and often hidden, system of network-communication, these devices presents a situation in which the user is in control of collected data: A ‘monitor’ provides the choice whether or not the data it collects is shared, a stand-alone ‘server’ aggregates the data users choose to share, and ‘reporter’ gives tangible feedback on the information.
