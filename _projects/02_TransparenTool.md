Transparent Tools is a family of household appliances that presents a future scenario in which users are actively involved in producing, repairing, and modifying their own products. By using 3D printed, CNC manufactured, and standard components, the resulting machines can be reproduced one-at-a-time rather than on the scale of mass production. The family of appliances consists of a toaster, a motorized grinder, an electric kettle and a vacuum cleaner.

Components of the original family of machines are changed and expanded to create a series of variations: an industrial-size toaster and an improvised vacuum built around a plastic thermos.
