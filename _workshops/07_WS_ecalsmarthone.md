Organized as part of the [Smartphone Companions](https://github.com/Smartphone-Companions) research project at ECAL/University of Art and Design Switzerland. Second-year Media and Interaction Design students created 'parasitic' objects that funtion together with the smartphone, and thereby question our behaviors with (and relationships to) these ever-present devices. Developed in collaboration with the Smarphone Companions research team: Alain Bellet, Lison Christe, and Martin Hertig.
