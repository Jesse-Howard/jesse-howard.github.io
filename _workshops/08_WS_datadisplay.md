Developed in collaboration with [Víctor Díaz ](http://www.victordiazbarrales.com) for students of the Contextual Design Master, this workshop cetnered around the search for ways to understand and represent real-time online data away from the screen. Over the course of two days, students developed working-prototypes to represent data through physical objects and installations.
