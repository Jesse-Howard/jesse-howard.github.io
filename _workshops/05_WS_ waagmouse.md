Organized as part of the Critical Making series at the [Waag Society](https://waag.org/), this workshop took a two-euro computer mouse as a case study: questioning the materials, production, and origin that relate to such a low-cost object. Expanding from this analysis, participants intervened in a normally 'closed' object, reconfiguring the fixed hardware to create new devices for 'scrolling'.
