Developed in collaboration with [Eugenia Morpurgo](http://www.eumo.it/) for [The Workshop Workshop](http://t-w-w.org/), Public Products guided participates through a process of re-interpreting an everyday object (in this case, a flashlight) toward new forms and typologies with more open, flexible, and distributed manufacturing processes.
