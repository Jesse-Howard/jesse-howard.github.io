Very pleased that one of the PCB designs from the Data and Devices objects has been re-worked into the cover images for Sabine E. Wildevuur's "Designing information and communication technology to enable person-centered care in chronic disease management". Photography by Cees Beuzekom, and graphic design by Pier Taylor.
