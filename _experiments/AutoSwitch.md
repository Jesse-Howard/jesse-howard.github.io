An early prototype for a two-way switch that can be manually toggled, or remotely switched on-and-off. Initally made for the thermostat prototype, the auto-switch became an integral part of the Candle Smart Home Prototypes as a method to add physicality to the normally unseen process of digital information flow in the Smart Home.
